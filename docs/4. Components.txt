==============
4.1 Dropdowns
==============

1. 
We start with a div with the class dropdown and then we have two components:
- the button or link: will trigger the dropdown
- the dowpdown itself in the menu

2.
The button have:
- class='btn dropdown-toggle'
- type='button' 
- id='dd-menu' 
- data-toggle='dorpdown'
<button class='btn dropdown-toggle' type='button' id='dd-menu' data-toggle='dropdown'>

We can add a small arrow:
<span class='caret'></span>

3.
For the menu: 
- unordered list with a class od dropdown-menu with a role of menu (for accessibility).
- list item with a role of presentation
- inside the list an anchor tag, href it's nothing, a role of menu item and a tabindex of -1 (prevent this link from being accessed by tabbing) 
<li role='presentation'><a href="#" role='menuitem' tabindex="-1">List item</a></li>

4. 
.divider
We can add dividers to the various elements
<li role='presentation' class='divider'></li>

5. 
.disabled
It's possible to disable a certain element by add the class of disable
<li role='presentation' class='disabled'><a href="#" role='menuitem' tabindex="-1">List item</a></li>

6. 
.header
Add headers.
<li role='presentation' class='dropdown-header'>A header - first group</li>

7. 
Change the apperance of the button adding
.btn btn-default
.btn btn-primary
...

8.
We can use this type of dropdowns inside:
- nav bars
- tabs 
- pills

=========
4.2 Tabs
=========

The tabs have two components:
- nav tabs: which contain links to the various sections
- tab content/ tab panes: contain content that will be switched

1.
ul
class= .nav .nav-tabs
list with anchors 

Each anchor with the following properties:
data-toggle = tab (to act like a tab)
href will link to the various ids that we'll set for individual tab panes
<ul class='nav nav-tabs'>
<li><a href="#section-1" data-toggle='tab'>Section 1</a></li>

2.
Usually the first tab it's the active one
Set the class of active to the first list item
<li class='active'><a href="#section-1" data-toggle='tab'>Section 1</a></li>

3.
Next tab content so we create a div with a class of tab content.
Inside three divs with a class of tab-pane times three with a id of section 1,2,3 and each one conatin some content <p>
<div class='tab-content'>
   <div class='tab-pane active' id='section-1'>
      <p>This is section 1</p>
   </div>

4. 
We can add a fade effect by adding a class to the .tab-pane
In the active one we have to ad .in to let it know that is the active one.
<div class='tab-pane fade in active' id='section-1'>

5. 
If instead of nav we want to use nav-pills
<ul class='nav nav-pills'>

6.
.nav-stacked
To stack
<ul class='nav nav-pills nav-stacked'>

7.
.nav-justified
Make tabs in equal size depending of the parent element
<ul class='nav nav-pills nav-justified'>
On screen readers smaller than 768 px these nav links are stacked.

===============
4.3 The Navbar
===============

1.
To place a navbar in the top of a page
<header>
<div class='nav navbar navbar-default' role='navigation'></div>

Inside we place all the navbar components
<div class='navbar-header'></div>

The navbar-header will contain the logo and to do a responsive version we have to add a button that will toggle that responsive version of the navbar.
<button type='button' class='navbar-toggle' data-toggle='collapse' data-target='#example-nav-collapse'>
<span class='icon-bar'></span>

The span will be the number of lists that are in the button.

2.
The actual tab contents we will define after the navbar-header div.

<div class='collapse navbar-collapse' id='example-nav-collapse'>

And inside we can put whaterver we want:
- menu
- forms
- dorpdowns
- links
...

With all this content added when we resize the page around 760px the navbar goes responsive.

The navbar have a few more options:
- set position as fixed on the top or at the bottom
.navbar-fixed-top
.navbar-fixed-bottom

A diferent variation of the sidebar:
.navbar-inverse
 
===============
4.4 List Group
===============

Can be used:
- displaying simple lists 
- more complex lists with costum content

1.
Start with a ul with a class of .list-group
Inside list items with a class of .list-group-item

<ul class='list-group'>	
<li class='list-group-item'>Some content goes here<span class='badge'>1</span></li>

2.
To link the items to something 
<ul class='list-group'>
<a href="" class='list-group-item'>Item 1</a>

3.
Add color
<ul class='list-group'>
<a href="" class='list-group-item active list-group-item-success'>Item 1</a>
<a href="" class='list-group-item list-group-item-info'>Item 2</a>

4.
The costum content
<div class='list-group'>
<a href="" class='list-group-item active'>
<h4 class='list-group-item-heading'>This is a heading</h4>
<p class='list-group-item-text'>This is the content.</p>
</a>
</div>

===========
4.5 Panels
===========

First a div
.panel
.panel-default
<div class='panel panel-default'>

A div
.panel-body
<div class='panel-body'>

Inside we can put anything we want.

1.
Add headings
We can add headings to the class of panel
<div class='panel-heading'>This is a panel heading</div>

2.
Make emphasis
If we want to put more emphasis in the heading we create a <h4> with a class .panel-title
<div class='panel-heading'><h4 class='panel-title'>This is a heading</h4></div>

3.
Add a footer
We can also have a panel-footer after the panel-body
<div class='panel-footer'>Panel footer</div>

4.
Add colors
just add the class to the main panel element.
<div class='panel panel-default panel-primary'>

5.
Panels and tables.
If we don't have a panel-body there is no distance between table and panel-heading.

6.
Panels and lists

=================
4.6 Modal Windows
=================

Modal Windows it's one of those windows that show up on a darker semi-transparent background. With a option of:
- click on a close buttom 
- click outside to close it

1.
A div with a class of
.modal
Give an id, ex.
modal-1
and a tabindex=-1 (so we can't tab through its contents)
role=dialog (help with accessibility)
<div class='modal' id='modal-1' tabindex="-1" role='dialog'>

2.
A div with a class of
.modal-dialog
<div class='modal-dialog'>

3.
A div with a class of
.modal-content
<div class='modal-content'>

It's a lot of markup but it's necessary in order to properly style it.

Inside modal content we have three sections:
- header - contains: close button and the title
- body
- footer

4.
Header
<div class='modal-header'>

Button
The button inside the header, it's going to close it's parent window
<button type='button' class='close' data-dismiss='modal'>&times;</button>

Title
We use a h4 with a class of
.modal-title
<h4 class='modal-title'> Modal title</h4>

5.
The modal windows only appears when it's trigger.
So before the modal we have to add a button.
<button type='button' class='btn btn-primary' data-toggle='modal' data-target='#modal-1'>Demo Modal</button>

6.
Next we create the body. With a div with a
.modal-body
<div class='modal-body'>

7.
Then the modal-footer which contains anything we want
<div class='modal-footer'>

In this case we create a close and a save buttom.  
<a href="#" class='btn btn-default' data-dismiss='modal'>Close</a>
<a href="#" class='btn btn-primary'>Save</a>

8.
It's possible to add a fade effect
.fade

9.
For bigger or smaller modal window we have two classes
It's added to the modal-dialog
.modal-lg
.modal-sm

===========================
4.7 Collapse and Carousels
===========================

-- 4.7.1 Collapse --

A colection of elements that have a heading and a body with content. And only expand the first element while the others are collapsed.

Bootstrap uses a panel group:

<div class='panel-group' id='#accordion'>
<div class='panel panel-default'>
<div class='panel-heading'></div> 
<div class='panel-collapse'></div>
</div>

1.
The panel-heading will just have the title
Create a h4 with a class
.panel-title

2.
Inside the h4
Create an anchor tag with: 
href to #content-1
data-toggle='collapse'
data-parent='#accordion' (the id of the accordion)
<h4 class='panel-title'>
<a href="#content-1" data-toggle='collapse' data-parent='#accordion'>Collapse 1</a>
</h4>

3.
On the panel-collapse add another class
.collapse in (since it's the first element, needs to be expanded at first).
Inside  a div with a class of panel-body
This will have a paragraph
Set and id='content-1'
<div class='panel-collapse collapse in' id='content-1'>
<div class='panel-body'>
<p> ... </p>
</div>
</div>

4.
Then repeat the times we need depending how many elements it's needed.
Update the #ID's
Remove the in class

-- 4.7.2 Carousels --

Carousel is better known as a slider.
Takes several images or several blocks of HTML and chenge them periodicaly or offer controls so you we can change them by hand.

Components:
The carousel class
- indicators: telling which slide it's active
- carousel-inner: hold the slides
- controls: left and right or previous and next.

1.
The carousel:
Div with a class
.carousel
.slide
data-ride='carousel'
id='carousel-example'
<div class='carourel slide' data-ride='carourel' id='carousel-example'></div>

2.
The indicator:
Ordered List with a class 
.carousel-indicators.
<ol class='carousel-indicators'>

A list item that has the data target attribute that points to the id of our carousel which is #carousel-example.
Then in the same list item we have data-slide-to='0' meaning which slide should that indicator go to. Times three.
<li data-target='#carousel-example' data-slide-to='0'></li>

3.
The carousel-inner:
Div with a class
.carousel-inner
<div class='carousel-inner'>

Inside each slide will be placed inside a div with a class of item
<div class='item'>

We can put anything inside. But let's make an example with some images.
<div class='item'>
<img src="../img/slide-1.jpg" alt='slide'>	
</div>

4.
The controls:
- anchor tag
- .left .carousel-control classes
- href='#carousel-example' (id of the carousel)
